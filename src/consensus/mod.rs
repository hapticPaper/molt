//! Proof-of-Verification Consensus Mechanism.
//!
//! Unlike Proof-of-Work (which wastes energy) or Proof-of-Stake (which centralizes wealth),
//! `PoV` "mines" blocks by cryptographically verifying useful work performed by off-chain agents.
//!
//! ## The Asymmetry Principle
//!
//! The protocol relies on computational asymmetry:
//! - **Generation (`P_gen`)**: High complexity (inference, optimization, rendering)
//! - **Verification (`P_ver`)**: Low complexity (hash check, physics sim, deterministic logic)
//!
//! ## Consensus Flow
//!
//! 1. Miner grabs a Solution Candidate from the pool
//! 2. Miner runs the deterministic `Verify()` function
//! 3. If True, Miner signs the solution and adds it to the candidate block
//! 4. Block is valid only if 66% of network agrees verifications are correct
